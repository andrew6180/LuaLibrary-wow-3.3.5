# Lua Library 3.3.5
### *A Collection of LibStub Libraries for World of Warcraft 3.3.5.*

This repo is intended to be the go to location to find libraries 100% working on stock 3.3.5. 

# Custom Servers
Libraries modified for specific servers can be found in the folder named after the server. **At this time there is none**.

# Contributing
Create a pull request with fixes or new libraries to add to the collection. Please update `libs.xml` to include the library as well if requesting a new library.

If adding a new custom server library, only add the lib to that folder's `libs.xml`. If there isn't one, create it.

# About each library
Most libraries can either be googled by name to find a description / api, or most have a comment header in their main lua file describing the library.
